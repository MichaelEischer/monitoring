=== QUICK INSTALL (Requires SVN) ===
To install and have Thermo running the quickest:
1) cd /path/to/nagvis/gadets/
2) svn co http://www.secure-computing.net/svn/trunk/nagvis/gadgets/thermo
3) mv thermo/thermo.php .
4) svn co http://www.secure-computing.net/svn/trunk/nagvis/gadgets/gadgets_core.diff
5) patch gadgets_core.php gadgets_core.diff

At this point, you should be able to select thermo.php as a gadget from WUI and
have a functional gadget.

=== THE LONG WAY ===


To install the thermo gadget, perform the following steps.

1) Download a copy of thermo from the URL above, or use SVN to checkout
   the entire directory with the following command:
     svn co http://www.secure-computing.net/svn/trunk/nagvis/gadgets/thermo/
   This will create a directory in your current working directory called
   thermo, with all the required files.

2) Move the thermo directory to you NagVis gadgets folder, which is usually
   located somewhere such as /usr/local/www/nagvis/nagvis/gadgets/.

3) Move the thermo.php file from the thermo folder up one level into the
   gadgets folder.  

4) All files within the thermo directory, the thermo directory, and the
   thermo.php file need to be readable by the webserver.  It is safe to
   run the following commands:
     cd /path/to/gadgets/
     chmod a+r thermo.php thermo/* & chmod a+x thermo/

5) I have also written a patch for the NagVis gadgets_core.php which 
   better supports the full Nagios performance data string.  As of NagVis
   1.4, you will need to manually apply the patch as follows:
     cd /path/to/gadgets/
     svn co http://www.secure-computing.net/svn/trunk/nagvis/gadgets/gadgets_core.diff
     patch gadgets_core.php gadgets_core.diff.txt

6) I know there are going to be bugs.  Please report them, so I may fix them.
   Send an email with bug reports to ecrist@secure-computing.net with a
   detailed description of the problem.
